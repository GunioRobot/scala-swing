The scala.swing package

This is a UI library that will wrap most of Java Swing for Scala in a straightforward manner. 
The widget class hierarchy loosely resembles that of Java Swing.

The library comprises three main packages:

  scala.swing
    All widget classes and traits.
    
  scala.swing.event
    The event hierarchy.

  scala.swing.test
    A set of demos.
